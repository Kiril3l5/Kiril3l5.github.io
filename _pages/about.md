## Why Autonomy Heroes?

Founded by automotive industry professionals with experience in OEMs and startups, we focus solely on automotive engineering roles, emphasizing autonomous driving features integration and validation. 

We established this agency after becoming disappointed in the dropping quality of candidates we received from various suppliers and their outrageous markup rates. We spent hundreds of hours training people who were either not interested in the job or were not compensated fairly. 

Our solution was starting Autonomy Heroes. Here is why we are different: 

* We are focused. We know how to recognize the perfect candidate, the right attitude, and the skills required to do the job. Why are we so confident? Because we are constantly looking for future colleagues we can rely on. We are not trying to find a name that loosely fits a role description and call it a day. 
* We are determined. Our interviewers work in the industry, our acceptance bar is higher than that of general recruiters. We do not tolerate laziness and tardiness. We find people ready to put in the hours, exceed expectations, and get promoted. No exceptions. 
* We are lean. There is no physical office, and there are no fancy dinners. Even this website is hosted for free using GitHub Pages. What does this mean? Our markup is lower, and employee compensation is significantly higher than our competition's or “industry standard.”
