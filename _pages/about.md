## Why Autonomous Heroes?

Founded by automotive industry professionals with experience in OEMs and startups, we focus solely on automotive engineering roles, emphasizing autonomous driving features integration and validation. 

We established this agency after becoming disappointed in the dropping quality of candidates we were receiving from various suppliers and their outrageous markup rates. We spent countless hours training people who were not interested in the job and were not compensated fairly. 

Our solution was founding Autonomy Heroes. Here is why we are different: 

* We are lean. There is no physical office, and there are no fancy dinners. Even this site is hosted for free using GitHub Pages. What does this mean? Our markup is lower, and employee compensation is higher than our competition's. 
* We are focused. We know how to recognize the perfect candidate. We know the right attitude and the skills required to do the job. Why so confident? Because we are constantly looking for future colleagues we can rely on. We are not trying to find a name that loosely fits a description and call it a day. 
* We are ruthless. Our interviewers work in the industry, meaning our acceptance bar is higher than that of general recruiters. We do not tolerate laziness and tardiness. We encourage continuous learning and development. We find people ready to put in the hours, exceed expectations, get promoted. No exceptions.
