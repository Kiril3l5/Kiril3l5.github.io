## Hire people who strive for excellence 

Our screening process rarely involves 'open to work' posts on LinkedIn. Instead, we focus on finding professionals already working in the industry. These individuals are focused and determined to learn new skills at every chance. However, this also means they are very busy and often unaware of the opportunities and growth they might have at other companies. 

We pride ourselves on taking good care of the candidates who come to us seeking the next opportunity that will allow them to learn more, be seen, and be appreciated. Our agency team is lean, allowing us to take less commission, which is directly transferred to the best market rates for the candidates. They love us, and we love to find a perfect fit for them without cutting any corners. 

If you believe that your company has open positions that require well above-average talent, reach out to us by filling out the form below. 

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”
